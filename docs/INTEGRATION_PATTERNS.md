# INTEGRATION_PATTERNS

## Local verifier client

Load trust bundles locally, verify action envelopes offline, and enforce policy before executing operations.

## Gateway enforcement

At service boundaries, verify artifacts locally before forwarding requests to external providers.

## High-risk action mode

Require challenge nonce for defined action types and reject missing/invalid challenge bindings.
